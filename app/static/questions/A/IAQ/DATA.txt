["Two summer air-conditioning systems with non-zero by pass factor are proposed for a room with a known sensible and latent heat load. System A operates with ventilation but system B operates without ventilation. Then the","bypass factor of system A must be less than the bypass factor of system B ","bypass factor of system A must be more than the bypass factor of system B","apparatus dew point for system A must be lower than the apparatus dew point for system B ","apparatus dew point for system A must be higher than the apparatus dew point for system B",2]
